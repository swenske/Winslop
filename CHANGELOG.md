🎉 So after some experiments, frustrations, and a few choice words directed at Microslop's UI stack, Winslop ultimately stays true to its roots.

**I need to vent about WinUI.**  
[I moved Winslop from .NET Framework 4.8.1 to .NET 10 first](https://github.com/builtbybel/Winslop/releases/tag/26.03.30) and honestly, that still felt like half a solution.  
**So I went straight for the next "logical" step: a WinUI conversion**

Here's the thing: I'm a minimalist. I like lean code, direct control, and software that doesn't require a small religion to maintain. That's why, in the Microsoft .NET ecosystem, I still stick with WinForms. Without WinForms, I probably wouldn't even keep a second OS partition just to run Windows 11. WinForms is one of the few things in the whole stack that still feels... sane.

**So, WinUI. "Modern Windows 11 UI experience", right? (Screenshot below)**

After about five hours, I had a working `MainWindow.xaml` and a connected feature page that sort of worked. But the scope and ceremony were insane. To me it felt like migrating a classic VB6 application to VB.NET back in the day. You know, back before Microsoft also decided to slowly suffocate VB.NET for sport.

**And I'm sorry, but why is everything so Microslop?**  
There was a time when you could build a full Windows app with a few forms and some logic. Now it feels like you need three frameworks, four patterns, and a ceremonial XAML ritual just to show a button. We managed to land humans on the moon in 1969 with computers weaker than a modern toaster — but in 2026 a simple Windows UI apparently requires half the Microsoft ecosystem and a small architectural thesis.

**F*ckkkk... Like… no, seriously. I'm not doing this. WinUI is a monster. It's not "modern", it's unbounded complexity disguised as progress.**  
It's a stack that constantly demands more structure, more glue, more patterns, more XAML rituals until your simple little utility starts looking like a corporate enterprise app with a thousand moving parts.

Sure, I could have made it easy and let a coding agent brute-force the conversion. But what's the point?  
Programming is something I genuinely enjoy. It relaxes me. But not like this. I'm not 19 anymore, chasing the Silicon Valley fantasy of a multimillion-dollar startup fueled by vibe-coding and buzzwords. I want to build software, not manage a labyrinth.

And honestly, I should have known better.

If you want to understand what WinUI is, just look at the "fancy" Windows 11 Explorer:  
pretty? maybe. but sluggish, inconsistent, and occasionally bizarre. It's the perfect demo of the WinUI promise and the WinUI reality.

**The slow parts are WinUI 3, and the buggy parts are Win32**

Microslop in a nutshell.  
No wonder 80% of Microslop apps are web apps now — even those often feel faster than WinUI.

So yeah. Sorry, folks. Winslop stays a classic WinForms app.  
I'm not spending my limited time on this kind of bullshit.
