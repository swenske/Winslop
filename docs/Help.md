## Quick start

1. Open **Winslop.exe**
2. Use the **tabs** to switch between areas:
   - **Windows**: system tweaks (feature tree)
   - **Applications**: app debloater (scan installed apps and remove selected ones)
   - **Install**: Install apps via winget
   - **Tools**: additional modules/extensions

3. Use **Inspect system** to scan/analyze.
4. Select the tweaks you want (checkboxes).
5. Use **Apply selected changes** to apply the checked items.

### Interface guide

Below is a quick overview of the Winslop interface.

<img width="455" height="656" alt="Winslop_annotated_outside_EN_v3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63187411-e783-4cca-9bb8-5fc38438e21f" />


### Top bar
- **Start button (☰)**  
Opens the main menu (selection actions, plugin/extension management, logs — varies by build).
- **Search**  
  Filters the current view (e.g., windows/feature;apps tree).  
  Tip: clear the search to show all items again.
- **Refresh**  
Updates the view and clears the log in the log window.

### Profile selector

- **Select profile… (dropdown)**  
  Loads a preset selection of tweaks/actions (a “profile”).  
  Use this to quickly apply a known configuration without manually checking every item.

  **Typical usage:**
  1. Choose a profile from the dropdown
  2. Click **Inspect system** (optional but recommended)
  3. Click **Apply selected changes**

  **Notes:**
  - Switching profiles usually updates which items are checked in the tree.
  - Available profiles depend on your build / included profiles.
  - You can export your current checked items to a simple `.sel` text file.
  - You can import a `.sel` file to restore a selection quickly.

Some builds also support auto-loading `selection.sel` from the same folder as the executable (opt-in prompt).

### Tabs
- **Windows**  
  Shows the feature/plugin tree. Items are grouped (e.g., *Issues*, *System*, *MS Edge*, *Privacy*…).
- **Apps**  
  Scans installed apps and allows uninstalling selected ones (if present).
- **Install** (winget)
Installs applications using winget.

  **Typical flow:**
   1. Search/browse available winget apps (depends on your UI)
   2. Select what you want to install
   3. Apply selected changes (install)
 
_Note: Application list parsed and adapted from the [WinUtil project by Chris Titus Tech](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil)_

- **Tools**  
Extra modules and extension views live here.
What you see depends on which extensions are included/installed.

### Feature tree (Windows tab)
- Checkboxes represent individual tweaks.  
- Checking a parent node typically checks/unchecks all children.
- Right-click a node for context actions (analyze/fix/restore/help) if available.

### Feature tree context menu (right-click)

Right-click any node in the **Windows** feature tree to open the context menu:

- **Analyze**  
  Analyzes only the selected node (or the whole group if you clicked a parent node).  
  Useful to quickly check the current state of a single tweak/plugin.

- **Fix**  
  Applies the selected node (or all checked items under a parent node).  
  This is basically a “run only this item” action.

- **Restore**  
  Reverts the selected node back to its original/default state (if supported).  
  For plugins, this uses the plugin’s undo/restore command when available.

- **Help**  
  Shows help/details for the selected node (what it does and any notes/warnings).


### Action selector (dropdown)
> [!TIP]
> **Online Log Inspector:** You can inspect the full log in a clean, readable view via the **Actions** dropdown menu → **Log Inspector**.

- **Select an action…**  
  A list of available log actions / helpers (depends on your build).  
  Typically used to perform a specific operation or change the logging behavior.

### Main buttons (bottom)
- **Inspect system**  
  Scans/analyzes the current tab content (e.g., detects system state, checks plugins, scans apps).
- **Apply selected changes**  
  Applies all currently checked items in the active tab (e.g., apply tweaks / uninstall selected apps).

## Notes / Safety

This tool changes Windows settings. Use **Inspect** first, review what is checked, then **Apply**.
Some changes may require sign-out or restart to fully take effect.

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary><strong>What’s the easiest way to share or restore my selections?</strong></summary>

  Use the new <strong>Export/Import</strong> feature for TreeList selections.

  <p><em>Note:</em> Placing <code>winslop-selection.sel</code> next to <code>Winslop.exe</code> was how this worked in older builds. Newer versions use the Export/Import flow (and will guide you through importing the file).</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where can I inspect the logs in a readable way?</strong></summary>

Use the built-in **Online Log Inspector**.

Open **Actions** → **[Log Inspector](https://builtbybel.github.io/Winslop/log-inspector/index.html)** to view the full log in a clean, structured format.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why are the footer hotkeys gone?</strong></summary>

Because the main actions are already reachable in **one or two clicks**.

Less noise, same speed.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about plugins?</strong></summary>

Plugins are **optional tools** that add extra features to Winslop.

You can install and manage them via **Main Menu → Manage plugins**.  
Once installed, you’ll find them in the main tree under the **Plugins** section.

Anyone can create plugins. This page explains how the plugin system works:
https://github.com/builtbybel/Winslop/blob/main/docs/plugins.md

And here’s a small demo plugin pack you can use as a starting point:
